        "content": "Our market is unprecedented right now, and it&rsquo;s a great time to buy or sell.&nbsp;Â What weâre experiencing in our market is unprecedented. Never before have we had such a strong sellerâs market while simultaneously experiencing such good buying conditions.Â As of the recording of this video, we have 34 active listings in Harrisonburg and 173 in Rockingham County. Weâve talked a lot about declining inventory the past two years or so, so itâs time to put this into a historical context.Â With just 34 active listings, based on last yearâs annual pace of sales, if there was no new inventory introduced to the market, weâd sell out in the next month. Rockingham County isnât much differentâthey only have a two-month supply of homes.Â Speaking of unprecedented, letâs talk about rates. Last week, the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped down to 3%. The last time we even got close to this mark was in 2016, and back then we didnât have the extreme disparity between buyers and sellers that we do now.Â âNever before have we had such a strong sellerâs market while simultaneously experiencing such good buying conditions.âWhen rates drop, affordability increases for most buyers, which creates a surge of buyer activity. If youâre a buyer, this means youâll face more competitionâespecially with dwindling inventory. If youâre a seller, youâll likely see a surge in showing activity and get offers quickly. With inventory dwindling to what I consider a dangerous level and buyer activity surging, now is the time to sell.Â Buyers may be frustrated with the lack of supply, but there will be more, and knowing that rates are as low as theyâve ever been, itâs also a good time to buy. As prices rise and rates go down, affordability generally stays the same.Â These conditions make it even more important to work with an agent who has their finger on the pulse of the market and has all the latest information. It may result in you being the one winning out in a bidding war, or generating a bidding war for your home.Â If you have questions about our Harrisonburg market or need help buying or selling, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to help you.Â ",

        "content": "I&rsquo;ve taken a look at the latest numbers, and I have important advice to share with homebuyers and sellers in the Harrisonburg area. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about the 2020 market.Â Before we know it, the spring market will be upon us. If you are thinking about buying or selling in 2020, now is the time for us to get together to plan for it, and hereâs why:For home sellers, being early to market is going to give you a win this spring. We do not need to be waiting until late March or April to get your house on the market. That may end up backfiring. There has been a major uptick in new housing starts, and competition for sellers this spring and summer may be stronger than what we have seen all of last year. Right now is the time for us to meet, get eyes on your property, and talk about any preparations it needs before putting it on the market.If you want to do a small bathroom renovation or get a fresh coat of paint put on before selling, now is the time to be making those arrangements before contractors get too busy. I can provide you with quality insights on what to do to get maximum ROI once I get eyes on your property.Â By the way, your house does not need to be in âshow-readyâ condition for me to come look at it the first time. I promise I wonât judge you â nobody lives in a home the way it looks on the market.âItâs never too early to get your financing in order.âFor buyers, I know it seems rough right now and like there is nothing on the market. Thatâs normal for this time of year. Get ready, though, because that is going to change fast. Now is the time for us to be meeting to plan your process if you are thinking about buying in 2020. Getting together allows us to plan out your timeline and make sure financing is in order.Timelines are also important. If your lease is up in June, we want to make sure we are actively looking by April to allow enough time to close (30 to 60 days). Itâs never too early to start getting financing in order either so you are ready to make an offer when the perfect home hits the market (which could be tomorrow).Get your taxes done. That refund could be a great jumpstart to your down payment or closing costs. By the way, rates are still historically low. Despite prices being up, affordability has not changed dramatically. Now is the time for us to be meeting to plan out your process.The bottom line is, no matter whether youâre buying or selling, letâs get together now and start talking about a plan for the fast-approaching spring market. Call/text/email me or hit me up in the comments. Iâm here to help. Also, please send this message onward to someone you know who needs to hear it! I love seeing my videos get shared!We look forward to hearing from you soon!",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Why are smaller homes becoming more and more popular? Find out today.Â Over the past few years, weâve noticed that smaller homes are becoming increasingly popular among homebuyers. Why is that, though?To understand this trend, first look to the younger generations of buyers, meaning Gen Z and millennials. These age groups are trending toward more urban, higher-density homes that provide greater access to amenities. Due to this, weâve noticed a rise in planned communities with a lot of mixed-use (i.e., residential and commercial) spaces in the same area.Older generations are looking for smaller, lower-maintenance properties as well. Theyâre looking for increased accessibility in their homes, ideally with fewer stairs.âPeople are trending away from larger homes to spare themselves the effort of cleaning and maintaining all that square footage.âThese two demographics are the largest segments of the market, which is likely why youâre seeing new construction home size trending downward. In 2019, only 20% of the homes we sold in total were 2,500 square feet or greater, and 93% of new construction homes were below that size threshold. The largest percentage of the market is looking for homes between 1,500 and 2,500 square feet. Â In general, I think that people are trending away from larger homes to spare themselves the effort of cleaning and maintaining all that square footage. Smaller homes prevent them from becoming house-poor and allow them to invest some of their money into experiences.I expect to see this trend continue in our market as we advance into the new decade.

        "content": "Today I&rsquo;m sharing what respected authorities like the National Association of Realtors and the Mortgage Bankers Association are predicting for 2020.Â On the tail of an interesting 2019, Iâm going to give a forecast for the real estate market in 2020. Hereâs what experts are predicting:Â Mortgage interest rates are expected to remain low. Experts from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, NAR, and the Mortgage Bankers Association are predicting that rates should remain fairly stable throughout 2020âgreat news for buyers looking to capitalize on the lowest rates weâve seen in history (all under 4%).Â Despite dwindling inventory, three of the four experts I just mentioned are predicting an increase in sales. Thanks to those low rates, buyer demand is still high, and with the uptick of new construction in our area, we expect to see more sales.Â âIâm very optimistic about this year.âSix of the expert entities that keep track of home prices are all predicting an increase in prices throughout 2020âquite in line with what we saw in 2019.Â A recession isnât likely, and if it does occur here, it wonât be severe. Last year, the number of forecasters predicting a 2020 recession was significant, but more recently, it has gone down quite a bit. No one knows for certain what will happen, but the experts do agree that, should a recession happen this year, its effect on the real estate market will be minimal.Â Iâm very optimistic about this year. Iâve got a lot on my queue and more people are reaching out to me every day. You may recall that I recently sent out a survey. 14% of respondents said they will buy or sell a house in 2020, while 42% said they plan to do a remodel this year.Â If you need any recommendations for contractors or builders, or have any questions about the market, feel free to call or email me.

        "content": "Generally, homeowners shouldn&rsquo;t sell for at least five years. However, here are three exceptions to that rule.Â If you own your home, or have ever thought about buying one, itâs important to know about the âfive-year rule.â Essentially, itâs a widely-accepted concept that you shouldnât sell your home until youâve owned it for at least five years.Generally speaking, if you sell a home within five years of buying it, you probably wonât recoup the costs from that sale. You may even end up having to bring money to the table. However, there are three notable exceptions to this rule:1. The property values in your neighborhood start to skyrocket. If you can time the market really well or if thereâs a crazy demand for homes in your neighborhood, then thatâs the time to sell. This is exactly why Iâm selling my home right now. I only bought it two years ago, but the neighborhood has been built out since and Iâm already sitting on a lot of equity. I should be able to walk away from the sale and put a good amount of the profit I make into my renovation project.âNot everything that you dislike about your home can be fixed with renovations.â2. The property values in your neighborhood start to plummet. We arenât really seeing this in our market right now, but itâs something you should be aware of. If prices start to drop dramatically in your neighborhood, it might be a good idea to sell now before prices get so low that you canât sell.3. You have a change in your lifestyle or mentality. If youâve gone through a job relocation, divorce, or youâre simply unhappy with the space, itâs not worth compromising your happiness to stay in the house. While many things that you dislike about your house can be fixed with renovations, not everything can.If you have any questions about what certain renovations might cost or if youâre curious about what you can sell your home for right now, donât hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "How much does a Harrisonburg home really cost? Let&rsquo;s discuss.Â Many people are unclear about what it really costs to buy a home. Fortunately, the total expenses of this purchase can be broken down into two categories: upfront expenses and cash to close, both of which weâll break down for you today.Â Before we do that, though, let me share an interesting fact: Did you know that you could buy a home in Harrisonburg with just $2,000? Itâs true, and as we share the cost breakdown I mentioned earlier, youâll quickly see how. Letâs dive right in.The upfront (or out-of-pocket) expenses include your earnest money deposit, appraisal fees, and inspection fees. Inspection and appraisal fees will each cost about $500, while earnest money deposits in Harrisonburg are typically 1% of the purchase price (or at least $1,000). This brings your total out-of-pocket expenses to $2,000.Â âBuying a home can be much more affordable than some people think.âThen thereâs the matter of your cash to close, which will consist of your down payment and closing costs. Your down payment will vary depending on the loan product you use, but some options allow you to purchase a property with 100% financing. In other words, you might not have to put any money down at all. Closing costs will also vary, depending on the lender you work with, but will most often range between 2.5% and 3% of the purchase price. In some cases, though, you can negotiate to have the seller pay them for you.Â So, hypothetically, a buyer whose out-of-pocket expenses are $2,000 could get a loan with 100% financing and could have the seller pay their closing costs. This means your entire home purchase could run you $2,000 out of pocket.Â The bottom line is that buying a home can be much more affordable than some people think.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "If your energy bills are higher than you would like, follow these four tips to make your home more energy efficient today.&nbsp;Energy-efficient homes are en vogue right now, and for good reason. Not only are they more environmentally friendly, but they also help homeowners save a lot of money on their energy bills each month. Best of all, you can make your home more energy efficient with just a few simple changes. Here are four simple tips you can start with:Â 1. Switch to LED lightbulbs. Even switching five of the most-used bulbs in your home to LED, you could save an estimated $75 per year off of your electricity bill.Â Â 2. Seal up air leaks. When air escapes from the small cracks around your doors and windows, your homeâs HVAC unit will have to work overtime to keep the temperature consistent. Simply adding draft guards around doors and caulking around windows and chimneys can make a massive difference.Â âNot only are energy-efficient homes more environmentally friendly, but they also help homeowners save a lot of money on their energy bills each month.â3. Heat and cool your house efficiently. Installing a programmable thermostat is one of the best ways to do so. These allow you to monitor and control your homeâs heating and cooling more closely. They even let you control your homeâs temperature remotely from your phone.Â 4. Maintain your HVAC system. A poorly maintained HVAC system equates to an uncomfortable living space and high energy bills to boot. So always make sure youâre changing your air filters and ordering annual (or bi-annual) check-ups to keep your HVAC in working order.If you would like an energy audit on your home before or after you implement these tips, please reach out to Charles Hendricks of The Gaines Group Architects by phone at (540) 437-0012 or by visiting his companyâs website: www.thegainesgroup.comIf you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "As I mentioned in my previous video, buying student housing in Harrisonburg is a tricky, yet worthwhile, pursuit. And, thankfully, there are options that allow you to do so.Â Â Before you decide to invest in student housing, though, realize that going under-rented for a consecutive year can be majorly detrimental to your cash flow and may jeopardize your investment. Most student housing is corporate-owned, so individuals looking to invest in this type of property will be up against some stiff competition.Â There are only a select few communities in which individual investors can purchase student housing, including Hunters Ridge, Bradley Drive Camden Townhomes, Pheasant Run, Fox Hills, and Campus View Condos. The properties in these communities fall under the umbrella of âtraditionalâ student housing.Â âIf you are thinking about buying student housing in Harrisonburg, you need to talk to someone who understands the nuances and regulations associated with doing so.âThese arenât your only options, though. You may also want to consider buying property in some non-traditional student neighborhoods, which essentially just means buying a townhome or condo in a regular residential neighborhood and then renting it out to students.Â Â However, if you choose to pursue this option, make sure that you are operating within city zoning restrictions as well as the CC&amp;Rs for a specific neighborhood. In most residential neighborhoods, only two people who arenât relatives can live togetherâa rule specifically designed to keep students from moving outside of student housing neighborhoods.Â And donât be fooled into thinking this rule can be easily bypassed. There is a lot of animosity among residents near JMU, where student housing and regular residential housing are somewhat intermingled. The last thing you want to do is break a neighborhoodâs restrictions and have to kick people out of their leases.Â Â The bottom line is that if you are thinking about buying student housing in Harrisonburg, you need to talk to someone who understands the nuances and regulations associated with doing so.Â Â As it happens, I started my career by working with student housing. I got my feet wet in the real estate industry at a property management company, which opened the door for me to sell nine condos in Hunters Ridge in my first year as an agent. Beyond that, I happen to be a JMU alumnus, so Iâm very much in-the-know about where students prefer to live in our area.Â Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, Iâm here to help and happy to catch; so please give me a call or send me an email.

Whether youâre a first-time investor, experienced investor, curious JMU student or alum, or JMU parent looking at buying instead of renting, these tips are for you.Â The biggest upside with this kind of investment is cash flow: Student housing typically cash flows very well on a monthly basis because you can rent by the bedroom. With student housing rents ranging on average from $450 to $600 per bedroom, you could see gross rents around $25,000 for the year.âI recommend hiring a property manager.âThe biggest downside is maintenance.Â Students are typically very rough on rental properties, so your turnover costs can be a lot higher.Â Itâs possible to mitigate risk by collecting higher security deposits, cleaning fees, etc., but know that if they really tear the place up, itâs a pain to collect back on it. I typically tell people to count on at least a full monthâs rent as a maintenance reserve for the year.I really recommend hiring a property manager. The headaches of dealing with potentially four different tenants with four different sets of parents or guarantors, joint leases vs. separate leases, and knowing when leasing season is at its prime are all nuances that you want a professional to handle.Â Stay tuned for part two with more Harrisonburg-specific considerations.If you have any questions for me in the meantime, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

Currently, weâre dealing with really tight inventory conditions, which naturally leads to a lot of multiple-offer situations and frustrated buyers.Â On the national and global level, thereâs also a lot of uncertainty about the economy and how that will ultimately affect the housing industry.

This is a 9% increase since 2014. Hereâs why homeownership is still considered such a good investment:1. Your home is a forced savings plan. By paying your mortgage every month, youâre building equity in your property, which you can then use for other investments like a kitchen remodel or a home equity line of credit. Equity in your home is one of the most accessible forms of cash out there.Â 2. The wealthiest 1% either have their hands in real estate or have made their money through real estate.

        "content": "Our company recently did an event called âIgnite Harrisonburgâ where we brought together about 140 community leaders to discuss the issues surrounding housing and development and to get an idea of what people really need.Â After we did some quick surveys and came up with a consensus, we found that the central theme was affordability: 66% of people said we needed more single-family homes in the $150,000 to $300,000 price range.Â Whatâs caused this affordability crisis? It all boils down to three factors:1. Resale prices are up. This is largely due to dwindling supply and rising demand amongst buyers. Inventory has been tight in all price ranges and that has made things challenging for buyers.2. There are similar housing needs across demographics. For the first time, millennials and retirees looking to downsize are searching for the same types of propertiesâstarter homes in the $150,000 to $300,000 price range I mentioned above. Thatâs where the demand is, and thatâs where the two largest demographics in the market are both looking.âWe need large-scale development in the $200,000 to $300,000 price range to meet the needs of the larger home buying demographics.â3. No new residential properties are being built on a large scale. If you see a lot of dirt being moved right now, itâs for either commercial property or student housing, and there are three reasons why this is: land is expensive, building costs are rising, and government restrictions have made construction expensive and difficult.Â Whatâs the solution to this crisis? There is no easy answer. Weâre dealing with a perfect storm thatâs led us to this situation. For one thing, we need large-scale development in the $200,000 to $300,000 price range to meet the needs of the larger home buying demographics, which will hopefully start a chain reaction for the other demographics.Â I would love to hear your thoughts on this topic and what our other needs are in Harrisonburg and Rockingham counties, so please feel free to leave a comment in the comment section below or click on this link and take a quick survey.

This is when most people are out and about looking for homes, which means their agents are out with them instead of sitting down at their computers checking the MLS for new listings.Â The first 24 hours on the MLS are crucial in terms of exposing your home to the most agents possible. Roughly 87% of all buyers have an agent, so you donât want to list your home when no oneâs looking.Â All agents have property alert systems on their phone, but scheduling showings when youâre out with other clients is very challenging, especially when youâre trying to give the common courtesy of a 24-hour notice.

Whether Iâm out showing homes to a client or skydiving (as I often like to do on the weekends), I have no choice but to go see it in these market conditions.

While on our tour, weâll also discuss Airbnb and the benefits of renting out your property. Â Airbnb made some major waves when it entered the scene a few years ago as an alternative to hotels for vacationers. Its purpose has widened beyond just vacation stays and is a popular option for tourists, people traveling on business, etc. Itâs opened the door for people who want to stay in a non-hotel setting while away from home.Â Harrisonburg has become a hub for tourism due to our magnificent downtown cuisine scene, and the Jacktown Loft is no exception to this; sitting right above two of the most popular bar-restaurants in the downtown area, itâs become a highly sought-after place for tourists to stay. If this interests you, be sure to contact the owner or check it out on Airbnb.Â âHarrisonburg has become a hub for tourism due to our magnificent downtown cuisine scene, and the Jacktown Loft is no exception to this.âThe Jacktown Loft is a four-bedroom, four-bath space with two queen-sized beds, two twin-sized beds, and a den area complete with a sleeper sofa.Â Before we dive into the tour, letâs briefly talk about the upsides of Airbnb for homeowners. Via Airbnb, a number of my clients have found success in offsetting their mortgage costs by renting portions of their home. Because thereâs an âat-homeâ feeling with these scenarios, thereâs certainly a lot of renter demand.Â In fact, two of my clients whoâve used Airbnb in this way have told me that theyâre paying their mortgage in full just from the rent theyâre generating. In short, it can be greatly beneficial to you as a homeowner to use this strategy. If you have any further questions pertaining to Airbnb, donât hesitate to contact me.Â In the meantime, letâs get to the tour! Starting at 2:51 in the video, you can see for yourself all that the Jacktown Loft has to offer.Â A big thanks to Aaron Ludwig and the whole Jacktown family for the opportunity to bring you this little preview of the loft.

At this point, appraisals have been finished, inspections have been done, and financing is in order. Itâs time to closeâbut what does closing entail? And why should you wait until Wednesday to close?At closing, the buyers, sellers, Realtors, representative or attorney, and lender will all meet. In some cases, people will sign documents at different times throughout the dayâthe seller comes by in the morning and the buyer comes later, for example.Â Sellers typically have fewer documents to sign; the buyer has to resign all of their loan documents, sign a number of disclosures, and more. The closing documents are then reviewed by both sides so that everything looks correct.âIf you set the closing date for Wednesday, you have a buffer of two business days on either side.âAfter this, the attorney takes the documents to the clerkâs office and has the deed recorded, which ends the closing. Keys are exchanged at the closing table, and this is a great time for the buyer to ask the seller any final questions they have.Â Though people often want to close at arbitrary times to save on things like proration, I think itâs a much better option to simply shoot for Wednesdays. I had a client who wanted to close on Friday in order to start moving on Saturday, but hereâs the problemâwhat if thereâs a delay?Â The closing is an âon or aboutâ date for both parties, so if you donât close on that set date, the closing could shift to a few days before or after it. Itâs done this way to avoid a pile of extra paperwork.If you set the closing date for Wednesday, you have a buffer of two business days on either side. This gives you time to wrap up any last-minute tasks, and it also gives you the ability to push your closing back a couple of days if needed. Then, you wonât be in fear of missing out on the perfect Saturday moving day!If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me.

        "content": "Â Real estate is a local business, but I know many of you who receive these videos live outside of the Harrisonburg, Virginia market I work in. Thatâs why I want to talk about how working with a Realtor outside of your local market can still benefit you, whether youâre buying or selling.First, itâs a familiar face to have a conversation with. Buying or selling a home is an important life decision, and itâs something you may not want to talk about with a complete stranger. If youâre in the beginning stages of the buying or selling process and youâre just trying to gather some general information, talking with a Realtor outside of your market is a great way to get some unbiased, realistic advice. Youâre not in a high-pressure sales environment, so you can have a truly honest conversation.âRealtors know how to find other quality Realtors.âSecond, you can gain familiarity with the process. Buying and selling a home is different from market to market, but not drastically so. If you need general information of what the process looks like when youâre thinking of doing either, talking to a quality agent in any market is a smart move. When you get down to the nuts and bolts of the upcoming transaction, thatâs when you want to talk to a hyperlocal expert.Third, youâll make connections with quality Realtors. Realtors know how to find other quality Realtors. When you need to find an agent anywhere in the world, itâs handy to be able to have another agent do some outreach on your behalf. Whether itâs through online reviews, our broker-to-broker network, conferences, or training seminars, I can match you up with someone in your area who will help you get the best deal possible.So, if youâre thinking of buying or selling a home and you know another Realtor who works in another market, donât be afraid to give them a call. Youâll know youâre working with a trusted advisor and youâre starting off on the right foot for one of the most important decisions of your life.If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, donât hesitate to give me a call. Iâd love to help you.Â ",

        "content": "When I talk to both buyers and sellers, thereâs no shortage of the question: âHow does one know if a listing is overpriced?âThere are two main factors that enter into the equation of a homeâs true value: its price and condition. Buyers are looking for value, which is a direct reflection of the price versus the condition of the property.Sellers thinking about listing their property need to understand that the name of the game is realistic expectations. Have a conversation with your Realtor and walk through your home viewing it through a buyerâs lens, rather than your own.âBuyers are looking for value, which is a direct reflection of the price versus the condition of the property.âThink about what a buyer may have misgivings about or object to when assessing the propertyâs condition, what updates can you make prior to listing that will maximize your ROI, and how you can compensate for what you canât control.As it concerns price, get to know the data and analyze the comparables in your area; if homes in your neighborhood are selling in 30 days or less, and your home is past that mark, itâs a direct reflection of the price or condition. Â Â Â To ensure that your home isnât overpriced, reduce the price in accordance with the collective buyer feedback, whether direct or indirect. As for condition, youâll likely have to put a little more thought, time, and resources into adjustments. The sticking point for buyers could be anything from an obnoxiously painted room that needs repainting to an outdated kitchen or bathroom that could use a remodel.Two signs, in particular, are all the evidence you need to know your home is overpriced:1.There have been no showings for three weeks.2.You havenât had a single offer after 10 showings.If you have any questions or need more information about all things real estate, please feel free to contact me.

        "category": "",
        "content": "To start off 2019 right, weâre going to share four key trends that buyers and sellers should keep an eye on this year:1. There will be more homes for sale, especially in the luxury markets. For the past year, all weâve been talking about is our low inventory levels. This past winter, we actually hit record lows. Weâve been joking that there are more Realtors out there than there are homes for sale right now. With all that said, we should expect to see inventory increase this year. With a modest slowdown in buyer activity, we should see supply recover. Where weâre really going to see a difference is in the $500,000+ luxury market, which has already shifted to a bit of a buyerâs market.âMillennials will still dominate the home buying market.â2. Affording a home is going to become more difficult. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we saw an increase in mortgage interest rates. This has dipped back down since the beginning of the year and has held fairly steady since, but we can expect to see rates go up at least twice in 2019. When you couple this with increased home prices, affordability will drop, making it harder for buyers. As for sellers, the earlier you list, the better off youâre going to be. The same message goes for buyers.3. Millennials will still dominate the home buying market. Millennials are now the largest demographic of homebuyers, making up 45% of mortgages. Expect that number to increase in 2019 as we see more and more first-time buyers.4. The new tax law is still a wild card. Many people thought that last yearâs tax reform would discourage home buying because of the increase in the standard deduction. However, we wonât really see that effect until people file their taxes in April. We should have some more answers on what this law will mean for our market in the next few months.If you have any questions about any of these topics or about real estate in general, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Itâs no secret that investing in real estate is a great way to generate passive income and increase your wealth. Today, I want to share four strategies so that you can start investing in real estate, particularly if you are in your 20s and 30s.1. House hacking. This is a great opportunity because most peopleâs first investment in real estate is their own primary residence. The basic concept of house hacking is that you buy a property and leverage some part of the property to create rental income to offset your housing costs. For example, you could buy a 2-bedroom condo and rent out a room. You could also buy a duplex and live in one side while renting out the other. That way, you get to experience being a landlord and property management while offsetting your housing costs.2. Short-term rentals. You can purchase a property in hot tourist areas or vacation spots. Charging a premium during peak seasons will allow you to offset the cost of the down season. You can also use Airbnb to get your property in front of potential visitors. Just make sure you check for any zoning restrictions on Airbnb in your area.âHouse hacking allows you to leverage your property to offset your housing costs.â3. Real estate investment trusts. If being a landlord is not your style, consider investing in an REIT. Real estate investment trusts are basically like mutual funds; a group of people pools their money in order to buy real estate assets together. This way, you can be a stakeholder and invest in the real estate market without the full responsibility of owning one asset yourself. If you are interested in REITs, I recommend that you check in with a financial advisor first.4. Financial reserves. Do you have financial reserves so that you can go a month without rent? Do you have enough money to maintain the property? If the washing machine, refrigerator, or air conditioner goes out, you need to be able to make those repairs. You need reserves to maintain the property in order to get a good return on your investment.These tips and strategies will help you find investment opportunities in your 20s, 30s, and beyond. Just give me a call or send me an email if you have any questions. I would be happy to help you!Â ",

        "content": "All year, weâve been hearing themes in the news like âprices are going up,â âsellerâs market,â âbuyer demand,â âlow inventory,â and so on. All of these signals seem to indicate that itâs a really good time to sell your home.However, there are a couple factors that could disrupt this trajectory for those looking to buy or sell a home:1. Mortgage rates have hit a seven-year high. Several weeks ago, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage interest rate increase to 4.6%, the highest itâs been since 2011. This follows the same trajectory that weâve seen over the course of the past year regarding increasing mortgage rates. Interestingly, mortgage applications spiked in September; this typically indicates that buyers think the rates will continue to go up, and based on other economic factors, we also predict thatâs the case.âA spike in mortgage applications typically indicates that buyers think the rates will continue to go up, and based on other economic factors, we also predict thatâs the case.â2. Affordability is dropping and buyer demand may follow. For someone who has a fixed monthly budget for their housing expenses, as housing prices and interest rates continue to rise, their buying power decreases. Where they were once able to buy a $250,000 home, they may no longer be able to afford that much anymore. If youâre trying to capitalize and get top dollar for your home, the time is now.Â 3. More and more home sellers are reducing their prices. With the seasonality of our market, itâs to be expected that prices will come down in the late fall and into the winter. However, the combination of increased interest, decreased affordability, decreased demand, and sustained high prices is leading to what we would expect to see: a more dramatic decrease in values.So what should we take away from this?If youâre thinking about selling your home, you really shouldnât wait to list. We canât tell whatâs going to happen over the next six months, so the time to act is now. For homebuyers, bear in mind that as those mortgage interest rates continue to rise, your buying power may decrease, so you should also consider acting quickly. Plus, who wouldnât want to get into a new home before the new year?If you have any questions about buying or selling in the current housing conditions weâre experiencing, feel free to give me a call.",

Looking out for these will help your home get sold and keep potential buyers engrossedânot grossed out!1. Moisture damage. 70% of homebuyers are put off by damp patches, moisture patches, and stained ceilings and walls. If you see any of these in your home, just roll on a fresh coat of paint.2. Bad odor. 56% of homebuyers dislike odor in a home, whether itâs from pets, smoke, or other disagreeable smells. You can combat this with tools such as oil diffusers, candles, baked cookies, or even some simple Febreze.3. Dull light. 54% of homebuyers reported that dull light is unattractive. Make sure burned-out bulbs are replaced, curtains and blinds are open, and you do anything else you can to avoid dullness. You want to frame your house in the best light possible!âThese are some important things to be aware of and consider.â4. Cluttered rooms. 15% of buyers are disappointed by a cluttered room. The solution is simple: Clean up. It makes the house feel larger and removes distraction, helping the buyer feel they can make it their own.5. Over-the-top decor. 14% report this as unappealing. While a certain style may work for you, you want buyers to see a house full of possibilities. Taking away the more outrageous decorations can help the imaginations of potential buyers run wild.6. Outdated bathrooms. 25% of buyers disliked an out-of-date bathroom. Styles change, and what was popular in the â70s is not so much anymore. It can be to your advantage to remodel old-fashioned bathrooms and bring them forward to the modern day.These are some important things to be aware of and consider, as they can make a huge difference in whether your home is sold or not.

        "content": "Weâre getting into the cooler weather now, so I thought it would be a good time to talk about selling your home in the fall and a few of the benefits that it brings:1. You have a more serious buyer pool to work with. In the spring and summer months, there are a lot of people with a lot of free time and a lot of houses on the market. There are plenty of buyers who are looking at homes that arenât really serious about making a move. As you get into the fall months, the concentration of serious buyers is much higher. Most of these buyers want to get settled into a new home before the holiday season, so your buyer pool will be more willing to make an offer.2. Thereâs less competition. The spring and summer months see a lot more homes on the market for sale, increasing competition among home sellers even in a sellerâs market. As we move into the fall months, there are a lot of people who still need to buy before the end of the year. Many sellers take their homes off the market during this time, but if youâre still on the market you will have a stronger bargaining chip.âListing in the fall gives you much more flexibility as a home seller.â3. Buyer demographics are different. In different seasons, youâll see buyers with different needs. For example, in the spring or summer, a family may be looking to buy a home, but they have to close before school starts in August. In the fall, it might be a very different situation. You might have a younger buyer who sees a good opportunity or a corporate worker whoâs is staying in a hotel until they are able to purchase a home. These different demographics create different motivations that can really become an advantage for you as a seller.4. More flexibility for improvements. I canât tell you how many sellers Iâve worked with who feel so much stress when it comes to getting their home ready for the market. They feel like theyâre under the gun. If youâre selling in the fall, you have the entire summer to make sure your home looks its best when it hits the market. It gives you the flexibility to enjoy your summer and plan your improvements in advance.These are just a few reasons why sellers should consider selling their home in the fall. If you have any questions for me in the meantime about selling your home or about the real estate market in general, donâtâ hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are five helpful questions you can ask yourself to determine whether youâre ready to stop renting and buy a home:1. Do you know how much you can afford? There are a lot of great online resources you can use to calculate a ballpark figure. Using an online mortgage calculator, for example, is a great way to find out what a mortgage will cost you. Keep in mind how much of a change this cost will be compared to your current living situation.2. Do you have the down payment amount available? Itâs a myth that you must put down at least 20% to buy a house. In fact, there are plenty of mortgage options out there that go as low as 0% financing. However, you should know what you are getting into when you agree to a mortgage loan and how your down payment amount will affect what your monthly mortgage costs. For example, the more you put down, the lower your monthly costs will be.3. Will you have enough money left after closing? Make sure you are not completely liquidating your savings in order to buy your house. I recommend having three to six monthsâ worth of savings in reserve after youâve covered your down payment and closing costs.4. Is your credit in good shape/What does your debt look like? These questions refer to the conversations youâll have with your lender before starting the pre-qualification or pre-approval process. If your credit is not in great shape and you have a high amount of debt, that will probably limit your purchasing power, so get these items sorted out first. A good lender will be able to help you do this and present you with strategies to either bring your credit up or reduce your debt load.5. Where do you see yourself in the next couple of years? If you only plan on being in a particular area for a year or two, buying might not be the best option for youâyou might still prefer the flexibility of renting. However, it is a good idea to do a cost-benefit analysis to know for sure. If it is going to cost you $1,500 to rent for two years but it will cost you $1,200 to buy a house, that might even things out. It all depends on what your investment in the property is going to be. If you plan on being in that area for three to five years, it definitely makes sense to go ahead and buy a home.âMake sure youâre not completely liquidating your savings in order to buy your house.âIf you have any more questions about this topic or are thinking of buying or selling a home, please feel free to reach out to me.

        "title": "How Sellers Should Handle Multiple Offer Situations",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "When you have multiple offers to choose from as a seller, all the cards are in your hand from a negotiation standpoint. Yet the decision between these offers shouldnât be made lightly. If you find yourself in this position, there are certain steps you should take when examining your choices to make sure that you select the best deal. The first thing you should do? Thank your agent for helping you into this position.Â After that, itâs time toÂ consider the prices. This is a crucial aspect of each offer, but it shouldnât cause you to dismiss all other factors. Look at all of your offers side by side and consider the different contingencies, timelines, and terms that are in play.For example, if youâre moving across the country in 30 days, you will likely be interested in different contract terms than someone whoâs just moving between neighborhoods. The amount of time the closing process will give you to move into your next home, per the terms of the offer, is an important point to consider.Â âAlways have a thorough conversation with your agent about the terms and conditions of each offer you receive.âYou must look at the buyerâs financing terms. A cash offer and a financed offer will have different contingencies.Also consider whetherÂ the buyer pre-approved or just pre-qualified?Â A pre-approved buyer should thought of as on the same tier as a cash buyer, since their offer is likely only contingent on an appraisal and appropriate title.You need to also consider how much they are putting down for their earnest money deposit. With how fast things are moving in our market today, it isnât uncommon to see buyers get cold feet. Earnest money is a good measure of a buyerâs commitment to a deal. And this is essential, because you donât want to take your home off the market only to have the buyer back out after the inspection.Finally, consider all contingencies.Â These can have a considerable impact on your transaction, so make sure you have a thorough conversation with your agent about the terms and conditions of each offer you receive.Â Remember: If your listing receives multiple offers, you hold the cards. You should negotiate the terms that best suit your goals. Just make sure that you donât overlook anything when examining each contract.If you have any additional questions about this or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me.

        "content": "How should buyers navigate multiple offer situations in a sellerâs market?This is a very common scenario right now. In fact, Iâve worked with three different buyers in the last two weeks who have encountered a multiple offer situation.Thankfully, there are ways you can be successful in standing out from among multiple offers. The key is to make your offer as attractive as possible, which can be achieved by implementing the following tips:1. Submit a large earnest money deposit. In our market, it is common to see very low earnest money deposits. Therefore, submitting a larger one can go a long way in showing the seller how serious you are.âIâve worked with three different buyers in the last two weeks who have encountered a multiple offer situation.â2. Show the seller youâre qualified. Thereâs a difference between a pre-qualification letter and a pre-approval letter. The latter is far more desirable in the eyes of the seller. But now, some banks are even doing whatâs called a âpre-commitmentâ letter. This letter will make your offer look even more solid.3. Give the seller time to move. Multiple offer situations can be just as overwhelming for sellers as they can be for buyers. So itâs important to be mindful of the sellerâs needs when submitting an offer on their home. Allowing them a little extra time to arrange their transition between properties can make your offer more attractive.4. Write your best offer. Unfortunately, buyers have much less room to negotiate when faced with multiple offer situations. With so many choices at their disposal, sellers feel less pressure to be accommodating. You may want to consider adding an executive summary to your offer. A clean, thorough, attractive offer will carry the greatest chance at success.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Inventory is the main reason we are in a sellerâs market. Our total supply is around 365 available homes for sale, which is down 20 homes from the previous year and almost 100 compared to the year before that.What does this mean for home values?
