We’ve had 138 attached home sales in our area so far this year, 68 of which were in Harrisonburg. On average,&nbsp;**the sellers behind these properties have been earning 99% of their asking price, on average.&nbsp;**

And homes aren’t just selling for high prices right now—they’re also selling quickly. Right now, listings are spending an average of just 35 days on the market. Conditions are so hot that we currently have just 16 attached homes available in Harrisonburg, and only 41 available across Harrisonburg and Rockingham Counties.&nbsp;

**This extremely limited inventory, especially among homes priced at or below $200,000, has caused many buyers to set their sights on townhomes.** And for those with a townhome to sell in our area, this is great news. Between this high level of demand and the fact that prices have risen 10% year to date, sellers are in a prime position to sell quickly and for top dollar.&nbsp;

The bottom line is this: Whether you bought a townhouse as a starter home or an investment property, now is the time to sell.

Of course, it’s also a great time to sell single-family homes. So if you have any other questions or would like more information about how I can help you with your real estate goals, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
