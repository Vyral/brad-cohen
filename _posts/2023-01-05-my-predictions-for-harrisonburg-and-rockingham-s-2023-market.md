2022 brought us a shifting housing market. What started out as a red-hot double-digit price appreciation market slowed dramatically in June when we saw mortgage interest rates double over the second half of the year. We watched a complete shift from what we've been living through for the last two years, and it has left a lot of people confused about what we can expect from 2023.&nbsp;

I want to give you some predictions about the 2023 housing market, but you should know that **everything that I'm predicting about the housing market depends on mortgage interest rates**. I believe that we have seen the peak for mortgage interest rates, and I expect that they're going to stabilize. That said, it depends on what happens with inflation and a potential impending recession.&nbsp;

For home sales, my prediction is that we are going to see fewer home sales than in 2022, which is also going to be a decline from the preceding two years. I believe we will return to a more normal market, comparable to 2019.

National experts are disputing what'll happen with prices, and it's going to vary market by market. Some are saying that prices will appreciate at a modest level and others are saying that they’ll depreciate. I think Harrisonburg and Rockingham have their own spot in the market, and here's why: **Rockingham is still a growing market with an inventory problem.** There is still a supply and demand issue that'll probably cause prices to increase.&nbsp;

However, due to the rising mortgage interest rates, don't expect to see double-digit appreciation like we have over the last couple of years. If we see rates come down, then it’s possible that we could see a greater rate of appreciation. I expect that we’ll see a more normal rate of appreciation again, comparable to what we saw in 2018 and 2019, to the tune of probably 4% or 5%.

Those are my predictions for the 2023 housing market. I expect a modest appreciation in values because of our local market conditions, but we’ll likely see fewer home sales because of overall market trends and mortgage interest rates.
