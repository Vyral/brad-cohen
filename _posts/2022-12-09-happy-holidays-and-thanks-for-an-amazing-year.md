Happy holidays\! No matter how you’re celebrating Christmas and New Year’s, I hope you have a wonderful time with your family. **We couldn’t be more thankful for all your support and business this year.&nbsp;**

If buying or selling a home is in your holiday plans, don’t worry—there are still plenty of opportunities out there. Searches on real estate websites tick up during the holiday season. This is likely because people travel to their relatives’ homes and get some ideas about where they’d like to live.&nbsp;

Our market has been insane recently, but I’ve still managed to have a very successful career, **and it’s all thanks to you.** If you have buying or selling plans next year, please call or email. I’d love to hear from you\!
