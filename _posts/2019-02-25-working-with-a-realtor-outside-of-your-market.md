Real estate is a local business, but I know many of you who receive these videos live outside of the Harrisonburg, Virginia market I work in. That’s why I want to talk about how working with a Realtor outside of your local market can still benefit you, whether you’re buying or selling.

First, **it’s a familiar face to have a conversation with.** Buying or selling a home is an important life decision, and it’s something you may not want to talk about with a complete stranger. If you’re in the beginning stages of the buying or selling process and you’re just trying to gather some general information, talking with a Realtor outside of your market is a great way to get some unbiased, realistic advice. You’re not in a high-pressure sales environment, so you can have a truly honest conversation.

Second, **you can gain familiarity with the process.** Buying and selling a home is different from market to market, but not drastically so. If you need general information of what the process looks like when you’re thinking of doing either, talking to a quality agent in any market is a smart move. When you get down to the nuts and bolts of the upcoming transaction, that’s when you want to talk to a hyperlocal expert.

Third, **you’ll make connections with quality Realtors.** Realtors know how to find other quality Realtors. When you need to find an agent anywhere in the world, it’s handy to be able to have another agent do some outreach on your behalf. Whether it’s through online reviews, our broker-to-broker network, conferences, or training seminars, I can match you up with someone in your area who will help you get the best deal possible.

So, if you’re thinking of buying or selling a home and you know another Realtor who works in another market, don’t be afraid to give them a call. You’ll know you’re working with a trusted advisor and you’re starting off on the right foot for one of the most important decisions of your life.

If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to help you.
