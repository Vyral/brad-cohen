Today I want to cover part two of multiple offer situations. Previously I went over this from the buyer's perspective, so now I will take a look at it from the seller's perspective in a seller’s market.

When you are considering multiple offers and have all the cards in your hand from a negotiation standpoint, you should first thank your agent. They did their job and brought you multiple offers.

Second, **consider the prices.** This is very important but should not come at the cost of dismissing all of the other factors. It’s very important when you have a multiple offer situation that you look at all of the offers side by side. You should consider all the different contingencies, timelines, and factors that are in play that can affect the contract down the road.

Remember that when you are in a multiple offer situation and in the contract process, getting the first contract is only the first step. All of the other factors that come into play get you safely through to the closing table. Of course, price will be a big factor in your decision. Everybody has their number that they are trying to get from their sale.

However, **you still need to think about the other factors that may come into play.** Are you moving across the country in 30 days or are you beginning your new home search in your own market? If you have not identified another property, you may want a little more time before you close on this home so that you have time to search for a new property.

You must look at the buyer's financing terms. A cash offer and a finance offer will have different contingencies. Also bear in mind that a cash offer may not actually be a cash offer as we have recently seen.

**Is the buyer pre-approved, or only pre-qualified?** A pre-approved buyer should be considered more like a cash buyer—contingent only on an appraisal and appropriate title.

You need to also consider how much money they are putting down for their earnest money deposit. It is not uncommon right now with how fast things are moving to see situations where buyers are getting cold feet. You want to be sure to make sure they are committed so that you do not take the home off the market only to have them back out at the home inspection.

**Consider all their contingencies**, including if there is a home inspection contingency or a home sale contingency. Is it contingent upon an acceptable appraisal? All of these different factors can affect you on the back end of the transaction as the seller. Make sure you have a thorough conversation about what those contingencies look like with your agent so you know how they could affect you.

The bottom line is that when you are the seller in a seller's market and you are dealing with multiple offer scenarios, you hold the cards. For this reason, you should negotiate the terms that are most acceptable to make sure your buyers are bringing the best possible offer with the most appropriate contingencies. Just make sure that you do not make the mistake of overlooking something in the contract.

If you have any additional questions about this or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
