Before selling your home, make sure you have these six buyer turn-offs under control. Looking out for these will help your home get sold and keep potential buyers engrossed—not grossed out!

**1. Moisture damage.** 70% of homebuyers are put off by damp patches, moisture patches, and stained ceilings and walls. If you see any of these in your home, just roll on a fresh coat of paint.

**2. Bad odor.** 56% of homebuyers dislike odor in a home, whether it’s from pets, smoke, or other disagreeable smells. You can combat this with tools such as oil diffusers, candles, baked cookies, or even some simple Febreze.

**3. Dull light.** 54% of homebuyers reported that dull light is unattractive. Make sure burned-out bulbs are replaced, curtains and blinds are open, and you do anything else you can to avoid dullness. You want to frame your house in the best light possible!

**4. Cluttered rooms.** 15% of buyers are disappointed by a cluttered room. The solution is simple: Clean up. It makes the house feel larger and removes distraction, helping the buyer feel they can make it their own.

**5. Over-the-top decor.** 14% report this as unappealing. While a certain style may work for you, you want buyers to see a house full of possibilities. Taking away the more outrageous decorations can help the imaginations of potential buyers run wild.

**6. Outdated bathrooms.** 25% of buyers disliked an out-of-date bathroom. Styles change, and what was popular in the ‘70s is not so much anymore. It can be to your advantage to remodel old-fashioned bathrooms and bring them forward to the modern day.

These are some important things to be aware of and consider, as they can make a huge difference in whether your home is sold or not. If you have questions or need further information, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to helping you.
