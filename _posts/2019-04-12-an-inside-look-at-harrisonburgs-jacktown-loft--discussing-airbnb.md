Anyone who knows me knows that I’m a huge advocate for and frequenter of Jack Brown’s, Billy Jack’s, and The Hideaway. What you may not know is that there’s an apartment space atop all of it called **Jacktown Loft**, and I’ve been granted the unique privilege to give you a tour of it. While on our tour, we’ll also discuss Airbnb and the benefits of renting out your property. &nbsp;

Airbnb made some major waves when it entered the scene a few years ago as an alternative to hotels for vacationers. Its purpose has widened beyond just vacation stays and is a popular option for tourists, people traveling on business, etc. It’s opened the door for people who want to stay in a non-hotel setting while away from home.&nbsp;

Harrisonburg has become a hub for tourism due to our magnificent downtown cuisine scene, and the Jacktown Loft is no exception to this; **sitting right above two of the most popular bar-restaurants in the downtown area, it’s become a highly sought-after place for tourists to stay.** If this interests you, be sure to contact the owner or check it out on Airbnb.&nbsp;

**The Jacktown Loft is a four-bedroom, four-bath space with two queen-sized beds, two twin-sized beds, and a den area complete with a sleeper sofa.&nbsp;**

Before we dive into the tour, let’s briefly talk about the upsides of Airbnb for homeowners. **Via Airbnb, a number of my clients have found success in offsetting their mortgage costs by renting portions of their home.** Because there’s an “at-home” feeling with these scenarios, there’s certainly a lot of renter demand.&nbsp;

In fact, two of my clients who’ve used Airbnb in this way have told me that they’re paying their mortgage in full just from the rent they’re generating. In short, **it can be greatly beneficial to you as a homeowner to use this strategy.** If you have any further questions pertaining to Airbnb, don’t hesitate to contact me.&nbsp;

In the meantime, let’s get to the tour\! Starting at 2:51 in the video, you can see for yourself all that the Jacktown Loft has to offer.&nbsp;

A big thanks to Aaron Ludwig and the whole Jacktown family for the opportunity to bring you this little preview of the loft. Again, if you have any questions about real estate, Airbnb, or the like, feel free to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you\!
