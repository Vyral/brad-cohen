Did you know that the Shenandoah valley was recently voted one of the hottest short-term rental markets in the country? These types of rentals are a critical part of our local market, so today I’ll share a few tips to help you run one:

**1\. Understand local ordinances.** You need to know the rules around running an Airbnb because some areas are more restrictive than others. For example, in Harrisonburg, you need to use your primary residence and own a special-use permit to run an Airbnb.&nbsp;

**2\. You’ll have to register for transient occupancy tax.** This is sometimes called lodging and accommodation tax, which is the same tax hotels pay.&nbsp;

**3\. Know your niche and get reviews.** It’s no secret that Airbnb is an experience. People aren’t looking for that typical overnight stay; they want a unique cabin, a super modern house, or something crazy like a yurt. Offer something unique, and make sure you get reviews—they help people know you’re a good host.

If you have any questions or want to talk about how to get into the Airbnb market, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to help.&nbsp;
