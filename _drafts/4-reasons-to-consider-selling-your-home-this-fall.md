We’re getting into the cooler weather now, so I thought it would be a good time to talk about selling your home in the fall and a few of the benefits that it brings:

**1. You have a more serious buyer pool to work with.** In the spring and summer months, there are a lot of people with a lot of free time and a lot of houses on the market. There are plenty of buyers who are looking at homes that aren’t really serious about making a move. As you get into the fall months, the concentration of serious buyers is much higher. Most of these buyers want to get settled into a new home before the holiday season, so your buyer pool will be more willing to make an offer.

**2. There’s less competition.** The spring and summer months see a lot more homes on the market for sale, increasing competition among home sellers even in a seller’s market. As we move into the fall months, there are a lot of people who still need to buy before the end of the year. Many sellers take their homes off the market during this time, but if you’re still on the market you will have a stronger bargaining chip.

**3. Buyer demographics are different.** In different seasons, you’ll see buyers with different needs. For example, in the spring or summer, a family may be looking to buy a home, but they have to close before school starts in August. In the fall, it might be a very different situation. You might have a younger buyer who sees a good opportunity or a corporate worker who’s is staying in a hotel until they are able to purchase a home. These different demographics create different motivations that can really become an advantage for you as a seller.

**4. More flexibility for improvements.** I can’t tell you how many sellers I’ve worked with who feel so much stress when it comes to getting their home ready for the market. They feel like they’re under the gun. If you’re selling in fall, you have the entire summer to make sure your home looks its best when it hits the market. It gives you the flexibility to enjoy your summer and plan your improvements in advance.

These are just a few reasons why sellers should consider selling their home in the fall. If you have any questions for me in the meantime about selling your home or about the real estate market in general, don't’ hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
