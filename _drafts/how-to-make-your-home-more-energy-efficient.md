Energy-efficient homes are en vogue right now, and for good reason. Not only are they more environmentally friendly, but they also help homeowners save a lot of money on their energy bills each month. Best of all, you can make your home more energy efficient with just a few simple changes. Here are four simple tips you can start with:&nbsp;

**1\. Switch to LED lightbulbs.** Even switching five of the most-used bulbs in your home to LED, you could save an estimated $75 each month off of your electricity bill.&nbsp;

<br>**&nbsp;2. Seal up air leaks.** When air escapes from the small cracks around your doors and windows, your home’s HVAC unit will have to work overtime to keep the temperature consistent. Simply adding draft guards around doors and caulking around windows and chimneys can make a massive difference.&nbsp;

<br>**3\. Heat and cool your house efficiently.** Installing a programmable thermostat is one of the best ways to do so. These allow you to monitor and control your home’s heating and cooling more closely. They even let you control your home’s temperature remotely from your phone.&nbsp;

<br>**4\. Maintain your HVAC system.** A poorly maintained HVAC system equates to an uncomfortable living space and high energy bills to boot. So always make sure you’re changing your air filters and ordering annual (or bi-annual) check-ups to keep your HVAC in working order.
